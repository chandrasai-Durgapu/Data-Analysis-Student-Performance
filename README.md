Exploratory Data analysis on Student performance

# 🎓 Student Performance Data Analysis

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and uses **Machine Learning** to understand and predict student performance based on various socio-demographic and educational factors. The goal is to identify the most significant features influencing academic success.

## ✨ Key Features & Goals

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Clean, wrangle, and visualize the dataset to uncover initial trends, distributions, and correlations between features.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transform categorical variables and create new features (e.g., total score) to improve model performance.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Develop and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Classification models) to predict final student grades or test scores.
* **Insight Generation:** Provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers to potentially improve student outcomes.

## 🚀 Technologies and Libraries

This project is built using Python and the following key libraries:

* **Python:** (Specify version, e.g., 3.10+)
* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (for model training, cross-validation, and evaluation)
* **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (Specify which one)

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis is based on the **Student Performance Dataset** (Specify the source, e.g., Kaggle, or the UCI Machine Learning Repository for Portuguese students).

The dataset includes features such as:
* Gender, Age, Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type (Standard/Free-Reduced)
* Test Preparation Course Completion
* Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing
